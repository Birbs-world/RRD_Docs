= Wind Turbines

## Wind Turbine Mechanics
Wind turbines have a area of effect. This means that the power production will decrease per amount of turbines in the area of effect. The area effect allows for a maximum of 4 turbines before they stop producing.

Having 4 turbines in an area will produce the same amount as one turbine.

The area of effect is as follows:

[cols=2,2]
|===
| Mk 
| Radius (foundations) 

| 1  
|  3 

| 2  
|  6 

| 3  
| 10 
|===

If you don't like the fluctuation in the power output, you can disable that in the menu. This limits the power output to half of the maximum.
