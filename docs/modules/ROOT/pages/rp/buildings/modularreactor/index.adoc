= Modular Reactors

== Introduction:
Modular Reactor is designed to fit with the Modularity of the existing mod buildings like Modular Power.

In version 3.1.0 this will be the first iteration of Modular Reactors, future plans are to add different variants to the existing components.
One future concept is to add a different reactor chamber to allow more power production.


== Design Concept:
Adding modularity to Reactors

* Foundation
* Support Ring
* Reactor Chambers
