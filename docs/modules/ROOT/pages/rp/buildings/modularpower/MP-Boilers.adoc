= Modular Power Boilers

## Building Information:
Boilers are placed on top of Heaters and will turn Water into High Pressure Steam. There is currently 2 variants of boilers, Mk1 & Mk2.

The Mk1 will consume approx 44m3/min water and produce approx 72m3/min High Pressure Steam.

The Mk2 will consume approx 77m3/min water and produce approx 123m3/min High Pressure Steam.

## Building Cost:

Boiler MK1 : 
20 Copper Sheet
12 Reinforced Iron Plate
4  Modular Frame

Boiler MK2 :
100 Copper Sheet
20  Reinforced Iron Plate
4   Heavy Modular Frame
