= Modular Power Generators

## Building Information:
Generators are built on the Converter Platform and can only function if attached to a Turbine. Power output will fluctuate based on the RPM of the attached Turbine, Only producing it's maxium output once it reaches the required RPM.

## Building Cost:
**LV:** 
15 Reinforced Iron Plate, 8 Modular Frame, 50 Wire

**MV:**
4 Heavy Modular Frame, 20 Circuit Board, 100 Quickwire

**HV:**
5 Supercomputer, 20 Heavy Modular Frame, 200 Quickwire, 15 High-Speed Connector


## Variants:
### LV
Low Voltage Generators produce 175 MW of power once reaching at least 10,000 RPM.

### MV
Medium Voltage Generators produce 300 MW of power once reaching at least 17,000 RPM.

### HV
High Voltage Generators produce 500 MW of power once reaching at least 25,000 RPM.
