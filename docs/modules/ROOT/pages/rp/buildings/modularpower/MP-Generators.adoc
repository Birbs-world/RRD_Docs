= Modular Power Generators

== Building Information:
Generators are built on the Converter Platform and can only function if attached to a Turbine. Power output will fluctuate based on the RPM of the attached Turbine, only producing its maximum output once it reaches the required RPM.

== Building Cost:
**LV:** 
15 Reinforced Iron Plate, 8 Modular Frame, 50 Wire

**MV:**
4 Heavy Modular Frame, 20 Circuit Board, 100 Quickwire

**HV:**
5 Supercomputer, 20 Heavy Modular Frame, 200 Quickwire, 15 High-Speed Connector


== Variants:
=== LV
Low Voltage Generators produce 150{nbsp}MW of power once reaching at least 10{nbsp}000{nbsp}RPM.

=== MV
Medium Voltage Generators produce 300{nbsp}MW of power once reaching at least 17{nbsp}000{nbsp}RPM.

=== HV
High Voltage Generators produce 500{nbsp}MW of power once reaching at least 25{nbsp}000{nbsp}RPM.
