= How to Farming - The Basics

To start your farming career you need two initial steps.

## Find and Dig for Jar of Dirt
Like normal Resources you need to find a Resources Node.
A Miner can auto collect this for you.
To get the first Seeds the easiest way is to extract Seeds from Dirt in the Workbench.
Later you can use the Seed Extractor

## Build you first Farm
With Seeds in your hand build a "Farming Platform" first.
After that Place a Plot on it.
Select the Crop you want to produce and place the seed in it.

## Collect your first Crops and close the circle
After a while you can harvest the first Crops from the Plot congratulation.
You will notice that the Jar of Dirt gives you Random Seeds.
If you want just one Seed convert the Crop that you have into new Seed.
After a while you can split this process so some seeds go back into the circle and some Crops into your Storage.
