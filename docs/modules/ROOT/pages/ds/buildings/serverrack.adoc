The Server Rack is a buildable that lets you snap Digital Storage Servers. 
The network connection is seamlessly passed to all connected servers.

The Server Rack has 22 Slots and allows a mix of different server sizes (1U or 2U).

Adding a new server to the rack is as simple as using the build menu, selecting the server and hovering over the server rack.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot deconstruct the server rack if items are stored in the servers.
